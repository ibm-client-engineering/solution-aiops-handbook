### Networking

#### Can you use an alternative port to 443 for the load balancer?

**No**. As of May 2025, this does not work and port 443 must be used as the UI port for the load balancer. There are AIOps services
within the cluster that will attempt to access `cp-console-aiops` via port 443.

### Offline Installation

Offline installations, also known as air-gapped deployment, is necessary if the target cluster will not have access to the internet.

#### Artifactory

If planning for an offline installation using Artifactory as the target registry, ensure that Artifactory meets the requirements for AIOps.

- The target repository layout must be set to **Docker**
- **Docker V2 API** must be enabled on the repository

##### üß™ Docker repository validation

Log in to the Artifactory UI and navigate to the target repository. There will be a type listed for the repository. That type should be
Docker.

##### üß™ Docker V2 API validation

Test if the Docker v2 API is enabled by running:

```bash
curl -u <username>:<password> https://<your-artifactory-domain>/artifactory/<repo-name>/v2/
```

- If it returns a `200 OK` or `401 Unauthorized`, the v2 API is enabled.
- If it returns `404 Not Found`, the repo may not support Docker v2.

##### ‚úÖ Artifactory URL Format

When configuring your container image mirroring to Artifactory, follow these guidelines carefully to ensure compatibility and avoid common pitfalls.

When specifying the Artifactory URL during the mirroring process:

- ‚ùå **Do not** include `https://` at the beginning.
- ‚úÖ **Do** append `:443` to the hostname.
- ‚ùå **Do not** include `/artifactory/` in the path like the file URL might display in the Artifactory UI. This is for file downloads only.
- ‚úÖ Use the format: `<artifactory-host>:443/<repo>/<path-to-images>`

For example, if your Artifactory host is `my-artifactory.company.com` and your repository is `internal-repo`, the correct URL might be: 
`my-artifactory.company.com:443/internal-repo/aiops`

##### üñ•Ô∏è Platform Requirements

Ensure that you are running on **RHEL 9** from the bastion host used to run the mirroring, as the `oc` version bundled with `aiopsctl` is compatible with RHEL 9.

You can verify your OS version with:

```bash
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

And check your oc version with:

```bash
oc version
```
